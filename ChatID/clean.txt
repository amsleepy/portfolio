(ed)ibilities Probability is not covered in detail in general stats and we get more of that covered 
(ed)ibilities Sometimes math and geometrical concepts gets thrown in lol 
(ed)ibilities Statistics is essentially applied mathematics lol 
(ed)ibilities There’s actually a difficult math concentration in the math major 
(ed)ibilities Actuarial science 
(ed)ibilities I mean the major takes some of my classes 
(ed)ibilities We have a stats class called statistics for insurance something 
(ed)ibilities Tbh they do make more than data analysts 
(ed)ibilities Data Science requires mathematical thinking 
(ed)ibilities Like in SF a data analyst would make $100-200k 
(ed)ibilities Data science would be more than that 
(ed)ibilities More than software engineering sometimes 
(ed)ibilities Because it’s CS/Math combined it’s fkin insane 
(ed)ibilities That’s why my professor keeps connecting geometry concepts on our stats class 😑 
(ed)ibilities He’s like optional but nice to know 
(ed)ibilities Sheesh I’m happy with $100k lol 
(ed)ibilities Marketing field pays a lot thou 
(ed)ibilities Marketing analytics to me could be something 
(ed)ibilities Who’s your professor?beepbop#9164 
(ed)ibilities Might take English 402. Idk 
(ed)ibilities holy crap its 3 weeks lol 
(ed)ibilities nvm I might just focus on my internship over the break 
(ed)ibilities Lifes hard bruh. Tbh my internship is saving me on rentbeepbop#9164 
(ed)ibilities I decided not to take out more loans to cover rent 
(ed)ibilities oh yea 
(ed)ibilities tbh SEL alrdy taught me some principles on business writing 
(ed)ibilities so I feel like I might learn the same stuff 🤦‍♂️ 
(ed)ibilities taking it in winter just lightens the workload for me next semester 
(ed)ibilities I’ve been told that I can take English 403 since I’m a non-native English speaker. Idk if it’ll easier or harder 
(ed)ibilities CS students dont really learn R lolEndeavour-1#4390 
(ed)ibilities Conceptually speaking yes you will learn the similarities of the language lol 
(ed)ibilities but Im a STATS major who program from time to time hehe 
(ed)ibilities depends on whats on your datasetEndeavour-1#4390 
(ed)ibilities probably list all those numbers. I just went back to read the previous chat 
(ed)ibilities So it would actually go like [1] # # # # 
(ed)ibilities now if you do use knit in pdf it wont output really 
(ed)ibilities I think that goes back to what I said. Its type list 
(ed)ibilities probably something with vector? I never learned loops in R but looks similar to Python for lists 
(ed)ibilities Tuples set dictionary etc. Im probably overthinking this haha 
(ed)ibilities <@717802770236702851> are those the variable credit class?AlyssaJ#8686 
(ed)ibilities Coz I took the Python one 😆 
(ed)ibilities When I was a DA major 
(ed)ibilities Yep 
(ed)ibilities It’s in Rjacob_m#5285 
(ed)ibilities Oh wait nvm 
(ed)ibilities My brain is mushed rn 
(ed)ibilities I use R extensively for stats but for statistical analysis not procedural programming and data structure concepts <@717802770236702851>AlyssaJ#8686 
(ed)ibilities Remember you’re in my 419 class 😆 
(ed)ibilities Fkin wasted my time trying to memorize those packages 
(ed)ibilities Lol and I submitted my project proposal using overleaf 
(ed)ibilities I also played soccer with the professor once but he doesn’t know it was me 
(ed)ibilities It shouldn’t make a differencejacob_m#5285 
(ed)ibilities I rarely use <- besides importing my file 
(ed)ibilities The only time it really matter is if you go x=y<-z 
(ed)ibilities There’s a precedence 
(ed)ibilities <@634567570435080213> 😆AlyssaJ#8686、i forgot#5006 
(ed)ibilities No 
(ed)ibilities She’s in the DA track for computing 
(ed)ibilities I just take classes at UI since some of my classes are missing lol 
(ed)ibilities Cook is pretty ez but had him 301Alysha#4569 
(ed)ibilities Treble Choir or University Singersdonk#0964 
(ed)ibilities They’re 1 credit classes but tbh you gotta put time and effort singing everyday 
(ed)ibilities welcome to collegeCapybap#2340 
(ed)ibilities My professor said we have officer hours during break 
(ed)ibilities not really lol 
(ed)ibilities I had a professor in community college who didnt give any students A 
(ed)ibilities I think community college is as hard as university. Most people say its easy because you take lower div classes there which is also easy here 
(ed)ibilities as far as ik UW is ranked 2nd in Pac-8 North and were dead last. But Pac-8 (DIV 2) schools arent really known to draft into NHLHydro Homie#1547 
(ed)ibilities grades dont mean a lot and it really depends on the recruiter and how they feel about chances at times 
(ed)ibilities at least minimum grade is sufficient thou 
(ed)ibilities Depends on which major he is interested in also 
(ed)ibilities Also note UW has a 55.9% acceptance rate and compare that to most top schools in CA which is way lower 
(ed)ibilities La Casa Lopez 
(ed)ibilities Tapped 
(ed)ibilities Breakfast Club 
(ed)ibilities Boeing stepping up with those donations 
(ed)ibilities They donated $50k to the Northwest Red Cross 
(ed)ibilities I wish we transitioned back to grass and so does the NFL instead of turf 
(ed)ibilities I got so many bad injuries being on turf. Not really good for your joints 
(ed)ibilities Plus mud is fun to play in when I did football back in middle school 
(ed)ibilities Guess who’s headed to Stanford tomorrow? MEEEE 
(ed)ibilities <@190664222026366977> Have you been to an away game for our football game?Tipster#8489 
(ed)ibilities Just wondering if buying the pre-game tickets to it is even worth it 
(ed)ibilities The one in Stanford btw 
(ed)ibilities k 
(ed)ibilities congrats!IHUNTYOU04#1068 
(ed)ibilities Im out of state from California 🙂 
(ed)ibilities Well good morning 
(ed)ibilities Fk I gotta get rdy for work and the snow is thickk 
(ed)ibilities One of my marketing job added 4hrs into my time sheet. Wonder why they’d do that 
(ed)ibilities Told em I only worked on the video for 2hrs 👀 
(ed)ibilities Pullman Airport out to screw ppl over lol 
(ed)ibilities They changed the boarding time back to the one before delayed one 
(ed)ibilities So some ppl got screwed over all 
(ed)ibilities Found the loml in greek row 
(ed)ibilities She basically said don’t be a p*ssy and drink. So I did 
(ed)ibilities That’s top secretbeepbop#9164 
(ed)ibilities I’m kiddin thou 
(ed)ibilities Someone in greek row did say that and we’re good friends now 
(ed)ibilities Especially when you host the games 😆 
(ed)ibilities I was pretty bad at pouring too much 
(ed)ibilities Stanford Uni here I come 🥱 
(ed)ibilities Gonna hit Stanford library later

LJ Probability for my investment to go tits up? Absolutely zero. 💎 <a:rocket:853675366026575893> 
LJ -*business major not a stats major* 
LJ Stocks only go up. -Warren buffet probably 
LJ ya Math no thanks 
LJ I’ll stick with my little computer stuff 
LJ risk probability is a massive demand in insurance right now 
LJ Huge demand for risk management too 
LJ Obviously those two positions work together 
LJ I’ve been speaking to Pemco a lot along with PayneWest and that’s all they talk about. Risk management and related 
LJ Yeah i bet 
LJ data scientists also make mad bank oml 
LJ Ez 6 figure 
LJ no sweat honestly 
LJ oh ya for sure 
LJ Poor data analyst maybe making 70-80 
LJ Honestly 70-80 a little generous too. Maybe like high 60s 
LJ Crazy 
LJ my mentor showed me an operations logistics manager position at boeing today that was posted for 150-180k today <:floosh:669719804072034314> 
LJ I don’t think my mentor realized how much money that meant to me. Obviously he is a professional and makes money like that 
LJ ya crazy 💰 
LJ Im happy with like 60 honestly 
LJ Starting at least 
LJ maybe 
LJ lol 
LJ Im just a down bad broke college kid 
LJ marketing <:weirdChamp:641149569346043924> 
LJ i will be taking 105 instead of 305 because of a schedule conflict 
LJ but theyre the same class 
LJ or rather fill in the same credit 
LJ I was anxious about this too but I got into my classes fineSpoooky#6969 
LJ you have to consider that technically enrollment is low right now 
LJ The odds are in your favor 
LJ Thinking about this too(ed)ibilities#4334 
LJ I’m kind of hard pressed to take classes wherever I Can since I dropped my calc class this semester and stretching 2 majors 
LJ Honestly my calculus credit requirement is stressing me the fuck out 
LJ If I can’t pass it now I’m not sure how I’m going to later 
LJ my teams class is actually a lot more technical than I thought 
LJ I think I might *actually* learn something from it 
LJ *wow* 
LJ <@983565173296074802> just thought of a project i could do to learn skills with SQL and visualizations tools like tableau(ed)ibilities#4334 
LJ Im gonna call it the Costco Project and Im going to compare the cost (and unit cost) of costco products versus products of like walmart 
LJ and see how much someone saves if they buy the membership of costco 
LJ so two main data sets costco product costs and walmart costs 
LJ query the data with SQL and then visualize the results. I would also synthesize the data from the set to create new data such as unit cost and display both the flat cost and the unit cost. this is due to costco selling more in bulk. I would probably have to pick and choose specific products such as house brands versus house brands. so kirkland versus great value. or I can see if there is one brand sold at both locations 
LJ host it online somehow 
LJ think it might be a fun project but also practical because my roommate and I shop at walmart AND costco and Im curious if our membership *actually* saves us money 
LJ im sure I can google that answer but I want to find out myself 
LJ *I literally thought of this in the shower* 
LJ Workday doesn’t consider daylight savings time 
LJ The system is an hour ahead 
LJ ?? 
LJ I think regardless if the rest of world moved ahead an hour and workday didn’t that’s a problem 
LJ It’s just one of those common issues in databases and enterprise systems that we’re taught in our MIS classes 
LJ It’s along the lines of a database accepting entries in multiple languages 
LJ A database might read something wrong if the input was in Spanish for example 
LJ It’s not a big deal for me inputting my hours but like I’m assuming workday has automated systems which are now operating an hour early <:6683_PK_Shrug:794710192150937601> 
LJ ok 
LJ lol 
LJ just finished my speech for my com class 
LJ its kind of shit but whatever 
LJ 13 secs short of the required time and i dont have time to retake 
LJ its probably passing but not an A 
LJ what class?AlyssaJ#8686 
LJ bro one of my planned classes was just straight up cancelled 
LJ Like just vanished 
LJ Not sure what happened 
LJ I got enrolled into all my classes! One class only had 2 seats left 
LJ I also don’t have any 9 am classes thank god <:prayge:931208039195889704> 
LJ I think my earliest class is 10:45 
LJ My professor just cancelled class basically due to the murders 
LJ said that she wouldn’t dock points for those who want to stay home 
LJ VMAS Friendsgiving 
LJ feat. My roommate and club president 
LJ yepbeepbop#9164 
LJ I said they were good to the person who made them but tbh they were a little tasteless 
LJ homemade 
LJ yeah not enough spice lol 
LJ I just found out that MGMT 315: Women in Management & Leadership is a required course for my major 
LJ I find that interesting. Not trying to criticize but I find it interesting that it carries the same value and weight as “International Management” and “Enterprise Business Development” 
LJ I originally thought it was an elective because of how specific it is 
LJ My teams class is kicking my ass 
LJ The quizzes fucking suck and the readings are like 50 pages straight from a text book 
LJ and the professor is such a nitpicky grader 
LJ It’s a one credit class and he’s just being annoying shaving 1-2 pts off of each assignment 
LJ So stupid 
LJ Omfg so fucking true 
LJ I know almost nothing on sports and my knowledge of sports is literally being graded 
LJ So dumb 
LJ idk contact legal services 
LJ just ask a general question 
LJ get some clarification 
LJ no 
LJ Comparatively to other washington universities like Gonzaga or UW it isnt the highest 
LJ but nationally it is far above average 
LJ Washington State is a powerhouse of college graduates. It has the highest percentage of education attainment percentage per adult above 25 (associate or higher) 
LJ WSU however has the highest retention rate comparatively in the state if I recall correctly 
LJ I typically take a notepad and a writing utensil when I go to events and stuffCapybap#2340 
LJ If you’re trying to network people notice those things 
LJ NO WAY 
LJ in my DTC class this morning haha 
LJ I felt like I did meh on my exam 
LJ Hopefully I still get an A 
LJ <:Clueless:898720694442016879> 
LJ ironically I always thought Id go to UW and then I never actually applied 
LJ I went to my 2 year and then wsu 
LJ I didnt even tour wsu before I got accepted 
LJ i frankly did not care that much lol 
LJ This too shall pass Kacey 
LJ I’ve definitely been there before 
LJ It did that for me too 
LJ I think it’s due to the increase of traffic 
LJ It’s typically slow around enrollment time 
LJ Econ classes are cursed probably clearly 
LJ i loved econ 
LJ i found it fun 
LJ What class?Spoooky#6969 
LJ i have that same class but at 1:10pm 🙂 
LJ mwf 
LJ very nice 
LJ <@704223188397326396> you should probably join the Carson college of business discordSpoooky#6969 
LJ you can find it in the hub 
LJ From my email 
LJ “N A M E” 
LJ funny enough this one came from the university 
LJ it’s all the same after all…. 
LJ tipster and his floppy disks 
LJ ive never even seen a floppy disk ill be honest

LJ Don’t worry it’s only a little cold <:dog_smile:987932646325764166> 
LJ It’s all relative 
LJ Actually just wear a t shirt and shorts 
LJ No shoes 
LJ very impressive caleb 
LJ honestly just walk into the class before 
LJ learn something new 
LJ the prof definitely does not care 
LJ i think this is a good sign if this is at the top of the page for an internship 
LJ also 
LJ i really enjoy how paynewest (tab at the end) has a general internship application 
LJ everyone else has specific posting for each internship opportunity 
LJ maybe they have to as theyre more technical (paynewest is insurance) but still lol 
LJ I have a speech outline due in an hour 
LJ And dam I do not feel like it 
LJ But I lose 20 pts 😦 
LJ on the final speech 
LJ And I want an A for my gpa :/ 
LJ This is such a minor inconvenience and I’m so fkin lazy lmfao 
LJ i did it 
LJ with 5 minutes to spare 
LJ it sucks ass but probably good enough 
LJ idk 
LJ ill iron it out before I actually have to do my speech 
LJ just walked through the snow at midnight to do my laundry 
LJ and other things i do in pullman 
LJ Im pretty sure I just took someone else’s coffee from Starbucks but I think it’s because someone took mine 
LJ We’re all getting the same thing drip coffee so it’s not a big deal 
LJ Anyway free coffee for Cub employees in the Cub <:pog:711949361504059452> 
LJ I am sitting in Avery rn waiting for my com lab

Capybap I was talking about my experience 
Capybap Intro classes here are insane Community college intro classrs are a cakewalk 
Capybap Ive heard some people day that 300-400 level classes are easier than 100level classes bc a lot of 100 level classrs are meant to be super hard to weed people out 
Capybap I mean Im stem and CC was super easy But i mightve just gotten lucky with profs 
Capybap Im comparing low lvls 
Capybap i over eight 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Facebook meme moment 
Capybap Yeah Im 6

Capybap Bruh 
Capybap Why the fuck is my chem exam 7-10 
Capybap Pm 
Capybap I was invited to attend a seminar Should i just listen or take notes? Its most likely material thats way over my head so 
Capybap I made sure to sit close to the front and no one was taking notes so i think i did ok with just doing that It was way way over my head but thats ok 
Capybap no 
Capybap and mine was completed a long time agop 
Capybap Stupid question but what does dead week even mean? Does it just mean the week before finals?

Capybap Oh damn Do you have one of those nose drying sprays? Those are so nice 
Capybap So I have 3 courses for spring semester rn and all of them count towards my degree the problem is that i literally cant add any other class that will count towards a requirement should i still take another class for 15 credits or? 
Capybap I will be joining a lab which counts for credits so 🤔🤔 
Capybap yeah i have more than enough luckily 
Capybap 4th wtf 
Capybap i will get a B+ if i get 14% on the exam 
Capybap nah i need like 84 according to the spreadsheet but i dont think it takes into account the 2 lab extra credit 
Capybap Im not at all prepared for the test tbh 
Capybap but its all multiple choice so whatever (Im going to do horrible still) 
Capybap Yeah it doesnt take into account in lecture activities or the lab EC i checked

Poedameron805 Mine is Alicia Casenormal name#8766 
Poedameron805 EZ mode lads. Got every single question right on the second Chem exam. 
Poedameron805 That was supposed to be the hardest one?

Poedameron805 oh 
Poedameron805 HAHAH took me a secondHydro Homie#1547 
Poedameron805 This probablyHydro Homie#1547 
Poedameron805 I mean it took me a second 
Poedameron805 And there’s this tooRockergage#5879 
Poedameron805 Bro 
Poedameron805 Is that low? 
Poedameron805 I’m so scared for ME 116 
Poedameron805 We are so behind because I was sick and I. Have basically no time before Thursday 
Poedameron805 I want a 4.0 but because I was sick I’m prob not going to get it :C 
Poedameron805 I so feel like were not even going to finish 
Poedameron805 I need my partner to respond saying whether they can do late night work 
Poedameron805 I at least need their files to make an assembly 
Poedameron805 I think we both know that we need the full assembly if we want any points but 
Poedameron805 Im just so scared. That even if we manage to get something done we wont have time for drawings or exploded view or any of the other stuff we need to do 
Poedameron805 I just want this to be over... And in like 30 hours it will be over. But until then I am just afraid and sad. 
Poedameron805 I hope we at least finish the assembly. If we dont we fail the class. If we do then we at least can get me an A- hopefully in the class... But Im just so scared and Im busy all day 
Poedameron805 She said no extensions. But I will ask just in case. Worst case scenario she says no. 
Poedameron805 I just hope my partner and I can figure it out. I honestly am scared we wont even finish anything which means we would fail the class. I will accept losing my 4.0 if we can *at least get something*. 
Poedameron805 It would hurt. But I just want to stop being afraid of failing. 
Poedameron805 ah well were not going to change our project with less than a day 
Poedameron805 so um... yeah. Teammate finally responded though. Looks like well try to pump it out tonight. 
Poedameron805 yes 
Poedameron805 Ill need it 
Poedameron805 xd 
Poedameron805 Trying to get some drawings made now but this one gear-shaped part wont let me fully define it 
Poedameron805 its either underdefined or overdefined but if I can fix it I can use it for another drawing. 
Poedameron805 sadly dont have much time before night today because Im taking the spanish STAMP test 4-7 pm 
Poedameron805 IKacey#5683 
Poedameron805 MIGHT 
Poedameron805 I will if I need to 
Poedameron805 I totally will 
Poedameron805 but we lose points for underdefined anyway so this would be a 2-in-1. And were also told to try and use more complex parts for drawingKacey#5683 
Poedameron805 well then hopefuly I can get a B as well 
Poedameron805 **if** we can finish an assembly that works 
Poedameron805 I can get a 50% on this assignment and get an A- in the class 
Poedameron805 but no assembly = fail class 
Poedameron805 my partners very hard working. I just dont know if we have the time and ability to get it out tonight 
Poedameron805 yeah it hurtsKacey#5683 
Poedameron805 I literally have over 100% in the class right now 
Poedameron805 but one week of sickness might ruin it all 
Poedameron805 sent her a message w questions but its unlikely to change anythingKacey#5683 
Poedameron805 yeah 
Poedameron805 same 
Poedameron805 Together as one... In pain we shall go! On our honor it will be done Then sweet freedom we shall know!Kacey#5683 
Poedameron805 ill be in person with my partner in sloan. that would probably be distracting both for him and i. But if I were cramming or something I would be glad to help youKacey#5683 
Poedameron805 YES I FULLY DEFINED THE GEAR. Now to try and make a drawing that isnt a mess. Because the sketch is definitely a mess. 
Poedameron805 yes. I cant work on assembly because partner had most of the parts because he made most of the parts because... he wasnt deathly ill at one point 
Poedameron805 BUT. I can work on these things to get me some points. 
Poedameron805 have to wait on doing literally anthing else now because some parts I made earlier that will help me make the drawing better did not upload to onedrive from the school computer. 
Poedameron805 So I will need to redo those for the third time. But once I do that this gear drawing should be easier. And then hopefully we make the assembly and everything will be ok. 
Poedameron805 Theyre pretty simple but its annoying that I have to do it again. And one of them was needed to make the gear part betterKacey#5683 
Poedameron805 We got it out that night 
Poedameron805 I think well be ok. In just a few hours it will all be over. 
Poedameron805 We will definitely be ok. I can even get myself a few points as well as my partner for no extra work on his part by doing a thing for a few hours tomorrow. 
Poedameron805 I think scariest part of this semester is over. 
Poedameron805 Have to go to work tomorrow without feeling 100%… but I know I can so I know I will. Kind of feel embarrassed w how much my partner did compared to me so I need to make myself feel better by having a semi decent work ethic instead of a non existen one. 
Poedameron805 I can get less than a 50% on my spanish final and get an A in the course 
Poedameron805 I think I can do the same with chemistry but Ill aim higher just in case 
Poedameron805 I mean Im aiming higher than a 50 on Spanish just out of principle... but still. Always nice for the end to be easy instead of stressful now tthat the me 116 project is over 
Poedameron805 Yuck 
Poedameron805 I’m going from 4 9 am classes per week to 3 next semester 
Poedameron805 Hoping to not get any early morning work shifts 
Poedameron805 So I can actually sleep in 4 days a week 
Poedameron805 Mate bit late for that one. Already survived a full semester of it XD 
Poedameron805 This week is pretty rough. Have to get up pretty early for an exam on Wednesday and then relatively early for 6 hours of work on Friday. But then it’s break! 
Poedameron805 OH 
Poedameron805 Dude 
Poedameron805 How does 9 early classes per week work? 
Poedameron805 You wake up soo early you lose an extra 2 days’ worth of sleep XD 
Poedameron805 No it’s not that bad 
Poedameron805 Thanks for the concern tho lol 
Poedameron805 Ouuuch 
Poedameron805 thats great XDCyanideCarrot#3879 
Poedameron805 It ends tomorrow 
Poedameron805 My fourth time taking chemistry 
Poedameron805 I better get an A in the class or I’ll be annoyed 
Poedameron805 Lol 
Poedameron805 So if you get a 20% ish you get an A? 
Poedameron805 Not going to lie I don’t trust the spreadsheet that much. Especially since my TA *still* hasn’t graded 2 of the labs 
Poedameron805 It probably doesnt take into account that EC.Capybap#2340 
Poedameron805 Im counting on the only 1 extra lab I could do before I got sick 
Poedameron805 And the syllabus being correct in saying that 900 points is an A in the class 
Poedameron805 I don’t know if you get extra credit for attending more than the required lecture activities 
Poedameron805 Nice 
Poedameron805 I just hope chem goes ok. Its the last thing between me and not caring about school for the next month or so 
Poedameron805 Thats good training though annoying for sure. 
Poedameron805 I would assume 
Poedameron805 For it surely as much as possible. Though as others have noted the fuzzy border between feasible and unsafe is approaching quickly...Gilgamesh the second#9213

Kacey has anyone gotten an email from WSU saying they have received a fafsa from you? 
Kacey I wasnt about to chance me getting into Mechanical Engineering by deciding on UW 
Kacey would have been so pissed if I did 2 years at UW just to not get accepted to their ME program and be forced to transfer

Kacey She was lenient on me when I was going through that final project 
Kacey she didnt give me an extension but she allowed me to change my project 2 days before because I gave myself a too complex thing to CAD. I spent like 30 hours nonstop cading and got a B on the assignment iircPoedameron805#0114
