YelpDB Application Overview 

The data used to construct the SQL database cannot be uploaded to github, therefore the code will not work as intended.
milestone3.py is the source code from which the application is run. The jsonparser.py file is responsible for inputting much of the data into the SQL DB.  
The tables will have need to have been created using the emmons-relations_v2.sql file. The SQL database on my local computer was constructed using postgresql.
